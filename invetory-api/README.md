# inventory-api

This project is intended to work as a simple inventory manager, accomplishing a complete **CRUD** of an `Item` object. The database used is **MySQL** (from **phpMyAdmin**).

The tutorials [Accessing data with MySQL](http://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-mysql/) and [Accessing Data with JPA
](http://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-jpa/) helped a little with this project.

* The main *Spring* resources used are:
  * Spring Data JPA module;
  * Spring Web MVC module;
  * The `CrudRepository` interface;
  * The annotations `@ResponseBody`, `@RequestParam`, `@RequestMapping`, etc;
