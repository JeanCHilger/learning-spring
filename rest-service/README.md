# inventory-api

This project works as a payroll system, using some good REST good practices.

The tutorial [Building REST services with Spring](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/) was followed in order to accomplish this project.

* The main *Spring* resources used are:
  * Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring HATEOAS and the Lombok modules;
  * ´Resource<>´ and ´Resources<>´ containers;
  * ´ResponseEntity´ container;
  * ´ResourceAssembler´;
  * *HAL*-type generation;
