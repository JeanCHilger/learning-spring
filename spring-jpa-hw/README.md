# spring-jpa-hw

This project is made following the tutorial [Accessing Data with JPA](http://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-jpa/) from Spring's web site.

The goal is to implement **Save and Read** functionalities for a in-memory database (H2). No URL routing is made.

* The main resources used from Spring are:
  * Sprind Data JPA module;
  * The `CrudRepository` interface;
  * `slf4j` logger (to test the saving and finding);
